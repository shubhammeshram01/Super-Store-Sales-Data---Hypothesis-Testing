# Super-Store-Sales-Data---Hypothesis-Testing
Perform hypothesis testing on data. Analyzed the data using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib library.

# Problem Statement :
The superstore dataset provides sales and profit data for a variety of products across different categories and regions. The goal is to analyze the data and identify insights that can help the company improve its business performance.It hopes to provide recommendations for the company on how to optimize its product offerings and improve its revenue and profitability.
# Gather and Clean Data :
Gather the data which need to analyze. This could involve collecting data from various sources or accessing existing data sets. Also, we need to clean the data to ensue its accuracy and consistency.

# Explore the data :
Need to explore data to get sense of what it contains. This might involves creating visualizations, calculating basic statistics or conducting exploratory data analysis techniques.

# Research Questions :
* Which product category have the highest profit margins in store?
* Are there any significant differences in sales between East and other regions?
* How do sales vary by product category during different months of the year?
* What is the rate of returned products for orders with same-day shipping compared to other shipping options?
* How do sales and profit vary by product category on wekdays compared to weekends?

# Assumptions :
* The superstore dataset contains a representative sample of all the transactions conducted by the store during the time period
* The data is accurate and has been cleaned and preprocessed prior to analysis
* The data is not impacted by any signinficant outliers that could skew te result of any analysis

# Hypothesis :
* Hypothesis 1 : Technology products have the highest profit margins as compared to the other product categories
* Hypothesis 2 : The east region has the highest sales compared to the other regions
* Hypothesis 3 : Sales are high during certain months of the year
* Hypothesis 4 : Orders with same-day shipping have the lowest rate of returned products
* Hypothesis 5 : The company's profit is more on weekdays than on weekends
